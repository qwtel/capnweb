// Represents the params to an RPC call, or the resolution of an RPC promise, as it passes
// through the system.
//
// `RpcPayload` is a linear type -- it is passed to or returned from a call, ownership is being
// transferred. The payload in turn owns all the stubs within it. Disposing the payload disposes
// the stubs.
//
// Hypothetically, when an `RpcPayload` is first constructed from a message structure passed from
// the app, it ought to be deep-copied, for a few reasons:
// - To ensure subsequent modifications of the data structure by the app aren't reflected in the
//   already-sent message.
// - To find all stubs in the message tree, to take ownership of them.
// - To find all RpcTargets in the message tree, to wrap them in stubs.
//
// However, most payloads are immediately serialized to send across the wire. Said serialization
// *also* has to make a deep copy, and takes ownership of all stubs found within. In the case that
// the payload is immediately serialized, then making a deep copy first is wasteful.
//
// So, as an optimization, RpcPayload does not necessarily make a copy right away. Instead, it
// keeps track of whether it's still pointing at the message structure received directly from the
// app. In that case, the serializer can operate on the original structure directly, making it
// more efficient.
//
// On the receiving end, when an RpcPayload is deserialized from the wire, the payload can safely
// be delivered directly to the app without a copy. However, if the app makes a loopback call to
// itself, the payload may never cross the wire. In this case, a deep copy must be made before
// delivering the final message to the app. There are really two reasons for this copy:
// - We obviously don't want the caller and callee sharing in-memory mutable data structures, as
//   this would lead to vasty different behavior than what you'd see when doing RPC across a
//   network connection.
// - Before delivering the message to the application, all promises embedded in the message must
//   be resolved. This is what makes pipelining possible: the sender of a message can place
//   `RpcPromise`s in it that refer back to values in the recipient's process. These will be filled
//   in just before delivering the message to the recipient, so that there's no need to transmit
//   these values back and forth across the wire. It would be unreasonable to expect the
//   application itself to check the message for promises and resolve them all, so instead the
//   system automatically resolves all promises upfront, replacing them with their resolutions.
//   This modifies the payload in-place -- but this of course requires that the payload is
//   operating on a copy of the message, not the original provided from the sending app.
//
// For both the purposes of disposal and substituting promises with their resolutions, it is
// necessary at some point to make a list of all the stubs (including promise stubs) present in
// the message. Again, `RpcPayload` tries to minimize the number of times that the whole message
// needs to be walked, so it implements the following policy:
// * When constructing a payload from an app-provided message object, the message is not walked
//   upfront. We do not know yet what stubs it contains.
// * When deserializing a payload from the wire, we build a list of stubs as part of the
//   deserialization process.
// * If we need to deep-copy an app-provided message, we make a list of stubs then.
// * Hence, we have a list of stubs if and only if the message structure was NOT provided directly
//   by the application.
// * If an app-provided payload is serialized, the serializer finds the stubs. (It also typically
//   takes ownership of the stubs, effectively consuming the payload, so there's no need to build
//   a list of the stubs.)
// * If an app-provided payload is disposed, then we have to walk the message at that time to
//   dispose all stubs within. But, note that when a payload is serialized -- with the serializer
//   taking ownership of stubs -- then the payload will NOT be disposed explicitly, so this step
//   will not be needed.
