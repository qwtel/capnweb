/**
 * Represents a reference to a remote object, on which methods may be remotely invoked via RPC.

 * `RpcStub` can represent any interface (when using TypeScript, you pass the specific interface
 * type as `T`, but this isn't known at runtime). The way this works is, `RpcStub` is actually a
 * `Proxy`. It makes itself appear as if every possible method / property name is defined. You can
 * invoke any method name, and the invocation will be sent to the server. If it turns out that no
 * such method exists on the remote object, an exception is thrown back. But the client does not
 * actually know, until that point, what methods exist.

/**
 * Represents the result of an RPC call.

 *
 * This isn't actually a JavaScript `Promise`. It does, however, have `then()`, `catch()`, and
 * `finally()` methods, like `Promise` does, and because it has a `then()` method, JavaScript will
 * allow you to treat it like a promise, e.g. you can `await` it.
 *
 * An `RpcPromise` is also a proxy, just like `RpcStub`, where calling methods or awaiting
 * properties will make a pipelined network request.
 *
 * Note that and `RpcPromise` is "lazy": the actual final result is not requested from the server
 * until you actually `await` the promise (or call `then()`, etc. on it). This is an optimization:
 * if you only intend to use the promise for pipelining and you never await it, then there's no
 * need to transmit the resolution!
